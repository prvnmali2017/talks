# For Github

Go to the _Settings_ tab for your repository.

Add your key and make sure you toggle write access.

You're done :)

# For Bitbucket

For Bitbucket, you'll need to add the key to your profile instead of a repository for it to have write access. You can do this from your profile, a link for which you'll find at the bottom left of your screen when logged in:

![](../resources/bitbucket-profile.png?raw=true)

Then, add a new key to your profile:

![](../resources/bitbucket-add-key.png?raw=true)

![](../resources/bitbucket-key.png?raw=true)
